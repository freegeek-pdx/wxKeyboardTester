  * add an Admin button (this won't show up on LTSP chroots) to the
    settings page that takes a password (4321) just so that it can't
    be accidently done. this will reboot the system into a shell.
  * switch the restart and quit buttons, change quit text to 'shut down'
    (Closes: #16165)
  * switch from the ugly CGI::unescapeHTML hack to using XML::Quote
  * make the text on the current values bigger (Closes: #16163)
  * mac: rename the insert key to the help key, as it actually displays
    on the keyboard
  * mac: fix the equal key on the numpad (Closes: #16162)
